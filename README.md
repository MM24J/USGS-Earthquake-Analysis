# leaflet-challenge

Utilizing data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), which provides data on climate change, the environment, and natural disasters, I created an earthquake visualization with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
The earthquake data on their website is displayed in GeoJSON format. It contains various datasets of earthquakes during different timeframes ranging from the past hour to the past 30 days. For the challenge, I looked at earthquake data from the past 7 days.
I pulled in the data from the JSON using D3. Using Leaflet, I created a map to display the locations of the earthquakes based on their latitude and longitude with associated markers and pop-ups which contain information on the location, depth, and magnitude of the earthquakes. Different colors were used to reflect the depth of the earthquake. The magnitude of the earthquakes determined the size of the markers. There is an associated legend at the bottom of the map. 
In order to complete the assignment, I used the Leaflet documentation that we were given in class and some of the code from the in-class exercises. I attended office hours where some concepts were further explained. The Challenge solution was shared with the class, and I used that to aid me in completing the challenge.
